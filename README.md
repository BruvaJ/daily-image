# daily-image

Sign-up and select an interest. Every day an image is selected at random from users interests and shared on the site and sent to subscribers inbox.

Started as an experiment with Django. Gradually evolving into a social media-esque project where users receive an image each day selected at random from all members chosen interests. 

Issue tracking for this repo done through github.
